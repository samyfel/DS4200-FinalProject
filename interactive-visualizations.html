            </div>
            <p><strong>Explore the relationship between sleep hours, hours studied, and exam scores based on teacher quality.</strong></p>
            <p>
                For this visualization, we were able to segment students based on Attendance, Exam Scores, and Access to Resources. 
                There seems to be a general pattern among the group that with higher attendance there tends to be a greater likelihood 
                of exam success, although this pattern is not entirely clear. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the more interesting aspect of this graph is the access to resources. With higher access to resources, when pressing 
                on that tab, there appears to be more students succeeding, and vice versa with the Low Access To Resources. This could potentially 
                imply that higher resources can help more students succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, through further studies, we could study the types of resources and how each resource could impact student performance, 
                as what these resources are appears to be unclear in the dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
                To interact with this visualization, one would need to utilize the tool tip. This tool tip gives the user information about the Score 
                the student received, the quality of their teacher, the number of hours they studied, and the number of hours of sleep that they received. 
                Additionally, it also has two panels to receive additional perspective on the visualizations.

            <h2>Visualization: Attendance vs Exam Scores</h2>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <iframe src="highlight_ratings.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Explore how attendance and exam scores are affected by access to resources.</strong></p>
            <p>
                For this visualization, we can see the connection between sleep, Exam Scores, Hours Studied, and Teacher Quality. On the first graph, 
                we can observe that students with "Medium" and "High" Quality teachers attributed more of the higher scores on the exam as well as less 
                hours of sleep for the students before the exam.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, through the second graph, we can see a general trend of students who were studying more tended to do better on the exam 
                as a whole. Overall, however, the general trend is slightly unclear.
            </p>
            <p>
                For future studies, we could further define what Teacher Quality means via metrics to get a better idea of how they relate to sleep, 
                hours studied, and exam scores, and get a better idea of how that relates to student success.
            </p>
            <p>
                To interact with this visualization, one could do two things. First, there are buttons with relations to the access to resources that the 
                user could press to filter the graph to solely highlight the group with each type of access.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, there is also a tool tip on the graph which the user could use to select data of certain points. Using this tool tip, the 
                user could see each point's Attendance, Exam Score, Access to resources, and Family income status.

            <h2>Visualization: Tutoring Sessions vs Exam Scores</h2>
            <div id="my_dataviz"></div>
            <p><strong>Analyze how tutoring sessions relate to exam scores.</strong></p>
            <p>
                For this visualization, we wanted to observe the connection between Tutoring sessions and Scores on the Exam Scores. 
                Tutoring sessions are typically services that are only available to higher or medium income level students, 
                so we wanted to see if it would make a difference in the scores. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While observing the graph, we cannot see a clear trend in the data, 
                suggesting that it is unclear what the impact of the tutoring sessions really are on students in this study based on the sheer scores alone. 
                However, with further analysis, we can potentially see other trends. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To interact with the visualization, click on each point to see the number of hours that each student received of tutoring.
