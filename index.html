            <h2>Significance of Student Success</h2>
            <p>
                Every teacher across the world will tell you that their goal is to make sure that their students succeed. When students succeed, they are more likely to continue their education, and go to university or trade school. Following their graduation from these institutions, they will likely find employment. When more young people are employed, the country has a more favorable economic outlook entering the next decades. With this chain of positive outcomes, a question quickly rises: what factors contribute to student success?
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the University of Southern California, student success is a measure of student engagement and outcomes. Factors like strong student-teacher relationships, encouragement of growth mindset, and an increase in inclusivity and equity on school campuses. However, these factors are all qualitative, and as a result, cannot be studied with a data-driven approach. Thus, for our project, we wanted to use the Student Performance Factors Dataset to study the factors that contribute to student success in a quantitative manner.

            <h2>Conclusion: Insights from Data Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Through our comprehensive analysis of the Student Performance Factors dataset, we uncovered several critical insights into the factors that influence academic success. By exploring various features such as hours studied, attendance, and parental involvement, we observed that while all these factors play a role, their impact is not uniform across different student groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our findings emphasized the importance of consistent attendance and its strong correlation with exam performance. Study time displayed diminishing returns beyond a certain threshold, suggesting the need for effective study strategies. Parental involvement emerged as a critical factor, particularly for underperforming students, underscoring the role of a supportive home environment. Using clustering techniques, we identified distinct groups of students based on their study habits and motivation levels, offering actionable insights for tailored interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, our findings highlight the multifaceted nature of academic success. Schools and policymakers can use these insights to design strategies that prioritize attendance, promote effective study habits, and encourage parental involvement. Moving forward, we recommend incorporating qualitative data, such as feedback on teacher effectiveness, and expanding predictive models with real-world datasets to refine interventions further. This project serves as a foundation for future research and a step toward creating environments where all students can thrive.
