            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to identify and analyze the key factors contributing to student success in academic settings. By leveraging a dataset of over 6,000 records and 20 features, including hours studied, attendance, and parental involvement, we use predictive modeling and clustering techniques to uncover actionable insights.
