            With a mean of 67.24 and a standard deviation of 3.89, we narrowed our scope of data 
            to visualize to be within 4 standard deviations of the mean in order to increase visibility 
            in differences around the mean.

        <p>
            From a visual perspective, most of these distributions seem fairly close together, with parental involvement 
            and access to resources having the most variation in their distributions. To assess which categorical variables 
            cause a statistically significant difference in their means, ùúá, a One-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test 
            was performed. This test is used to find if the mean for two or more independent groups differ from each other. 
            Given the hypothesis:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Ho:</strong> ùúá1 = ùúá2 = ‚Ä¶ = ùúák <br>
            <strong>H1:</strong> At least one ùúái ‚â† ùúáj for some i and j, ùõº = 0.05
        </p>
        <p>
            Where k is the number of subgroups, the null hypothesis (Ho) will be rejected if p, the probability that the groups' 
            means do not differ, is less than 0.05, and we can proclaim that at least one group is significantly different from 
            the rest. The results of this test (Table 1) show that every categorical feature, except for Gender and School Type, 
            creates a significant effect on student performance (at least for one group).

        <p>
            The correlation of the continuous features to performance (exam scores) demonstrates the strength of a relationship. 
            While only hours studied and attendance seem to correlate significantly (see Figure 2 and Table 2), instead of discarding 
            features based just on correlation values, a more statistically powerful way to determine relevant features is through 
            significance testing. To assess which continuous features create significant differences in student performance, the 
            Pearson-Correlation Coefficient Test can be used. This test is used to find if two variables are correlated significantly, 
            or if the correlation could be caused by random chance. Given the following two-tailed hypothesis:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Ho:</strong> ùúå = 0 <br>
            <strong>H1:</strong> ùúå ‚â† 0, ùõº = 0.05
        </p>
        <p>
            Where ùúå is the correlation coefficient, the null hypothesis (H0) is rejected if the probability that the correlation is due 
            to random chance is below 0.05. By doing so, we can say that a certain feature creates a statistically significant difference 
            in student performance. Through this statistical testing, only sleep hours were deemed statistically insignificant.

        <h2>IV. Multiple Linear Regression</h2>
        <p>
            A multiple linear regression model was fitted to the data. All points, where the score is within 4 standard deviations from 
            the mean were kept. This was done for the following reasons/assumptions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Large outliers cause poor performance in data fitting</li>
            <li>By removing large outliers, we can create a model that is more robust to typical scores</li>
            <li>
                Outliers, which typically happen to the right, indicate that some students perform better than the expected population. 
                Other factors that are not considered (such as outside education and IQ), could cause these differences, and are not 
                reflective of the true population given the features involved.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The features input (after removing irrelevant features) are: <strong>Learning Disabilities</strong>, <strong>Parental Involvement</strong>, 
            <strong>Access to Resources</strong>, <strong>Teacher Quality</strong>, <strong>Internet Access</strong>, <strong>Peer Influence</strong>, 
            <strong>Distance from Home</strong>, <strong>Parental Education Level</strong>, <strong>Extracurricular Activities</strong>, 
            <strong>Motivation Level</strong>, <strong>Family Income</strong>, <strong>Tutoring Sessions</strong>, 
            <strong>Hours Studied</strong>, <strong>Physical Activity</strong>, <strong>Previous Scores</strong>, and <strong>Attendance</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            All categorical features were transformed using one-hot encoding to convert to a numerical feature. This gave a model 
            with a <strong>MAE</strong> of <strong>0.31</strong> (which indicates the expected absolute error between the predicted 
            value and expected value) and a <strong>R-squared</strong> value of <strong>0.9335</strong> on the test set, which indicates 
            a great fit of the model to new data.
